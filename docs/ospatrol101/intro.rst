OSSEC 101: Introduction
-----------------------

What is OSSEC 101?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  OSSEC 101 is an attempt to illustrate a walkthrough of an OSSEC lifecycle.
  The guide will be a walk-through from installation, to active response, and (most) everything in between.


Who is the target audience?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Anyone interested in using OSSEC. We hope to include information for installations of all sizes.
  A level of technical knowledge including (but not limited to) basic Linux administration is assumed.
  This document will instruct you to edit files, but will not walk you through using a text editor.


What do I need to use OSSEC?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A linux or unix system is required for an OSSEC server. Microsoft Windows is only supported as an agent, and agents require a server.
